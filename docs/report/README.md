 - different illumination condition
 - shadow
2. Automation
 - recommend algorithms and parameters offline for preprocessing and detection
 - handle changes in environment online
3. Adaptability
 - can easily adapted to handle different Robosub missions
 - make full use of data obtained from different domains
4. Ease of Use
 - knowing what data to collect and use minimal amount of data
 - rapid development of algorithms and testing
 - ease of including prior knowledge
5. Low detection latency

## FYP Focus
