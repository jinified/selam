\chapter{This semester}

\section{Existing problems}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Very costly to acquire large training data
    \item Manual selection of algorithms and parameters based on expert
          knowledge required
    \item Expensive sensors needed to achieve robust tracking. Non-visual based
          sensors i.e LIDAR and sonar provides competitive edge
    \item State-of-the art tracking algorithm has high detection latency. Not
         suitable for real-time application 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Robustness
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Different water bodies i.e lake, ocean
            \item Changes in illuminations
            \item Shadow
        \end{itemize}
    \item Automation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Automatically chooses algorithm and parameters for
                  preprocessing offline
            \item Automatically tune camera parameter to achieve optimal image
                  for further processing
            \item Recommends object detection algorithm given image
        \end{itemize}
    \item Flexibility
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Easily adapted to different Robosub missions
            \item Algorithm scales with more training data
        \end{itemize}
    \item Rapid Prototyping \\
        Very fast iteration with limited data collection. Able to learn on the
        fly or suggest what data to collect
\end{enumerate}

\section{How do we measure success?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Accuracy across different challenging dataset
    \item Precision of bounding box
    \item FPS
    \item Number of training data vs accuracy 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mental blocks}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ensemble approach vs automatically choosing the best algorithm
    \item Focus on preprocessing vs working on color space that is not affected
          by illuminations and color degradation
    \item Domain adaptation / transfer learning vs independent task learning
    \item Using multiple cues and features vs simple features that just work
    \item One general framework that works for different tasks while allowing
          unique strategy to be built for specific task
    \item How much invariance needed to be enforced? Affine?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Innovations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-parametric approach
    \item Ensemble approach i.e bagging, boosting
    \item Detection free approach when near object
